- I am starting this journey to becoming a software developer studying with ALX. 
- The main thing that actually got me on this journey was a bad UX experience with an app I used at a job. Hopefully I can build a new one at the end of this.
- Coding definitely takes a certain level of stubborness because you have to be patient in order to solve issues in your code.
- ***Here is to a good time and a long time.***
